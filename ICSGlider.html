			<li>Grab a sheet of letter-sized paper. </li>
			<img src=IMG_20170223_142409.jpg alt= "A sheet of letter-sized paper." height=192 width=256 >
		
			<li>Fold in half to make a crease then unfold. </li>
			<img src=IMG_20170223_142456.jpg alt= "A sheet of paper folded in half" height=192 width=256 >
		
			<li>Fold corners of the top tips of the plane down so that they meet an eighteenth of the way down. </li>
			<img src=IMG_20170223_142528.jpg alt= "A sheet of paper with corners folded inwards." height=192 width=256>
			
			<li>Fold top tip down such as it meets the other two corners previously folded. </li>
			<img src=IMG_20170223_142548.jpg alt= "A sheet of paper with tip folded downwards." height=192 width=256>
			
			<li>Now, fold the edges in, as shown below. </li>
			<img src=IMG_20170223_142611.jpg alt= "A sheet of paper with the edges folded in." height=192 width=256>
			
			<li>Again, fold the tip of the plane downwards to just go over the corners of the previous folds. </li>
			<img src=IMG_20170223_142706.jpg alt= "A sheet of paper with the tip folded downwards." height=192 width=256>
			
			<li>Using the zoomed-in photo below, tuck the tip of the previous flap in and under the folds in step 5. </li>
			<img src=IMG_20170223_142727.jpg alt= "A sheet of paper with the corner creased." height=192 width=256>
			
			<li>Here's what it should look like now. </li>
			<img src=IMG_20170223_142752.jpg alt= "A sheet of paper with the corner tucked in." height=192 width=256>
			
			<li>Fold the plane in half entirely making sure the folds are on the outside of the plane.</li>
			<img src=IMG_20170223_142821.jpg alt= "A sheet of paper that is beginning to ressemble a paper airplane." height=192 width=256>
			
			<li>Finally, fold the wings of the plane so that it matches what you see the the picture below.</li>
			<img src=IMG_20170223_142912.jpg alt= "A sheet of paper with wings." height=192 width=256>
			
			<li class= "done">Done! You can see the final results below at two different angles!</li>

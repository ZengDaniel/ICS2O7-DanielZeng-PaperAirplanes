		<h2> <a id="history">History</a></h2>
		<p>The legacy of the paper airplane starts somewhere in China, where legend says that a wise monk thought of a brilliant idea which lead to several outbreaks of aviation but unfortunately, this monk shortly died as the concept of paper airplanes started to become very popular. Since then, paper airplanes spread all over the globe, even becoming a sport at one point! Even now, people all over the world are still busy at work, designing the perfect paper airplane trying to break the current world records.</p>
		<h2> <a id="Science">Science</a></h2>
		<p>Many forces act on a paper airplane as it flies through the air. As the airplane leaves the hand of the &ldquo;;thrower&rdquo; the intial energy is the thrust of the plane &ndash; the force that propels the plane forward. Secondly, we have the counterpart of the force; a.k.a. the drag from the air that pushes the airplane back. Of course, if the drag to thrust ratio becomes equal to or more than 1 the plane would stop moving forwards. But, that would be the least of our concerns; the real force that stops the plane would be gravity. Gravity is the force that our planet exerts on objects close to it, and as you might of guessed, our plane is one of those objects and would drop to the ground eventually. A scientific study was conducted fairly recently that all objects will fall at the same rate, but then why doesn't our paper airplane fall to the ground at the same speed a rock would? Well, to answer that question, we need to introduce the 4th and final force. Lift. This force is what makes paper airplanes fly and is what separates the planes that fly from the planes that do tricks and to the planes that don't fly. What good paper airplanes do is how efficently they can convert other forces into lift, which keeps the plane in te air. This is what made paper airplanes an extremely fun and cool way to spend people's times, (even scientists and especially aviators).</p>
		<h2> <a id="world">World Records</a></h2>
		<p>Many world records have been set for airplanes being the fastest, longest flight time, furthest flight, and even for the highest number of loop-de-loops! <a href=#recordPics>Below</a>, we can see many of the world records being set. Firstly, we have the award for furthest flight, which was awarded to John Collins, who's airplane flew 226 feet and 10 inches to break the world record. His plane was a glider plane named Suzzanne. Next, on the right of the first image, we have the record holder for the longest flight time... Takuo Toda! His plane, which was shaped like a giant space shuttle, flew for 29.2 seconds! </p>
